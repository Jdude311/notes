    <h1>Announcement</h1>
    <p>This is a volunteer project. Don't attack me over not having something incorrect or something not working, it's free notes. Also: as of now, the inline links in the notes don't work (I'll be working on trying to fix that, but in the meantime, it'll just have to be that way).</p>
